Coding instantly caught me !

I always thought that Life Science & studying about micro-organism is gonna be my thing, I imagined myself working and researching in the same field , It sounded like an appropriate dream given my B.Sc in Microbiology . I also did couple of internships but it kinda felt meh . I craved to learn more , to learn something different 

That’s when I did a mini certificate course of “INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE” and I found data science to be extremely interesting , the spark I was missing ignited instantly I clicked ‘play’ on my first python tutorial 

All these factors led me to pursue Masters in data science . I instantly chose M.Sc in data science to continue my further studies
